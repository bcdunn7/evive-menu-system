# Evive Menu Ordering System

A simple meal ordering system. Accepts a meal and order via numbers ("Breakfast 1,2,3") and then returns the items ordered ("Eggs, Toast, Coffee") or throws an error if input is invalid.

### How to Run Locally

1. Clone or download git repository
2. "`npm install`" to download dependencies (i.e., jest - if installed globally this step can be skipped)
3. Run "`npm test`" to run tests
4. Run "`node app.js "ORDER"`" to run script where ORDER is a meal and item numbers (e.g., "Breakfast 1,2,3")
